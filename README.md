# Innovation
Our website allows for a direct communication between hostel residents and hostel staff regarding there presence in hostel keeping an update on students' in time and out time by face recognition, promoting a safer environment within
the hostel. Additionally, the feature of admin approval for night leave and to track the students' location if she is not present in hostel allows for a more organized and secure platform.

# Challenges
## Security of user data
We need to keep in mind the student concern regarding protection of sensitive information by implementing robust authentication and authorization measures, including the use of Google Authentication.
## 24/7 Availability
Ensuring that the web portal is available 24/7 was a challenge as it required the use of robust hosting solutions like Vercel.
## Negligence from the user
The user needs to share the location herself and if a person goes in emergency mode she needs to be online for safer side.
## High maintenance
The website has to be checked upon on time to time basis due to security issues and has to be updated to the best of knowledge.

# Future Scope
Integrating live chat functionality for real time conversations.
Large number of users which require detailed database for easy scalability.
Incorporating emergency services by using emailing systems to alert the users of the notifications.
Wide spread use so that more students get the benefit.
Government approval for swift operation in collaboration with security authorities and local police for more safety.
24/7 availability to ensure student safety.
